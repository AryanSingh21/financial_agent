1. System Architecture - Why Multiple Agents?

Architecture Overview
The system employs a 3-agent architecture with specialized roles:

Financial Analysis Agent (Orchestrator)

Main coordinator and decision maker
Combines insights from specialist agents
Provides final recommendations and confidence scores


Sentiment Analysis Agent (Specialist)

Dedicated to financial sentiment analysis
Processes market-relevant language and terminology
Extracts emotional context and investor sentiment indicators


Market Impact Assessment Agent (Specialist)

Focuses exclusively on market impact evaluation
Analyzes sector effects and stock movement predictions
Assesses risk levels and time horizons

2. Design Decisions and Rationale

2.1 Agent Interaction Pattern: Orchestrator + Specialists
Decision: Use a main orchestrator that calls specialist agents via tools
Rationale:

Provides central coordination and context management
Ensures consistent output format and quality
Allows for complex decision logic combining multiple specialist inputs
Maintains clear data flow and dependency management

2.2 Data Flow Architecture: Sequential with Context Passing
Decision: Sentiment analysis feeds into market impact assessment
Rationale:

Market impact is often influenced by sentiment context
Sequential processing ensures consistent interpretation
Allows market impact agent to leverage sentiment insights
Mirrors real-world financial analysis workflow

2.3 Output Structure: Strongly Typed Pydantic Models
Decision: Use structured Pydantic models for all outputs
Rationale:

Ensures consistent, parseable results
Enables automated validation and error detection
Facilitates integration with downstream systems
Provides clear contracts between agents
